            <p>It’s a mystery how the subway still functions the way it does today. The system constantly struggles to manage its finances, the walls are constantly cracked, barely any of the stations are modernized, with some being exactly identical to how it was in the 1800s, and there are constantly mechanical problems causing delays of the trains. Manhattan, on the other hand, has been renovating each year, with neighborhoods gentrifying. Take a look at the financial district. Each year, new skyscrapers are built. How about the subway? You would expect the subway stations in the financial district to be modernized and well kept. However, that is not the case. Stations like at Wall Street are poorly kept. The 2nd Avenue station in the Lower East Side is a complete contradiction to its modernized surroundings outside the station. You can quite literally smell the cracks on the walls without actually seeing the cracks; the tens of hundreds of homeless people on the tracks and the platform edge at night waiting to sleep. Yet, the subway is able to function well enough that millions use it everyday. The millions of commuters and the people who live in the subway each do their part to allow the subway to function. Stations 25 feet above or below ground are managed by the commoners of New York. Druggies, mentally ill people, or businessmen, all do their part to contribute to how we know the subway today. Crazy, right?

              Of course, the subway is not just for getting you from point A to point B. Many people make a living in the subway; they attempt to encapsulate the city life above it. There are those old grandmas sitting at a southbound platform, waiting for people to buy their chiseled bread. Many people before them have praised the subway for allowing them to survive.

              The place is also a melting pot where commuters are forced to share the same spaces– perhaps for a minute or an hour– and experience the city’s rich tapestry. We all experience, once in a while, the craziness and look at each other in disbelief, embracing and enjoying the moments. You enter the station. On one corner of a station, you might see dozens of homeless people smoking weed. And on the next corner you might see the Cleveland Cavaliers roster. And the corner after that, into a southbound platform, there might be people offering cigarettes to you or even dads with their child on their back trying to sell you their chocolates to earn a living. Just the other day, I was at Union Square and three fully dressed black men started talking obnoxiously loud and asked people if they “wanted to be put to sleep”. Or on the L train, a group of men was having a full blown dinner– with two ribeye steaks and 5 glasses of wine bottles– in the middle of the subway car. Although it is a “wtf” moment for most of us, deep down we all feel the same way: this is entertainment you cannot get elsewhere. It is these unexpected moments that make the subway a little adventure– sometimes enjoyable, sometimes horrific. The subway gives you an experience you cannot experience elsewhere in the world. <strong>

              The little lights seeping out the subway entrances is like a gateway to a whole new city. The people that use the subway everyday we call commuters, I call tourists. I have my condolences to those who walk through the entrances of the subway everyday. Swiping through the turnstile, we all prepare ourselves for a messy train ride. We may be walking on the same linoleum flooring everyday but we are witnessing new things everyday. Everything is unpredictable. There is no guarantee that once you enter the subway, you exit the subway. One day, someone is struck by a train because he or she was pushed off the ledge. The next day, there is someone on the subway surfing on the 7 train that causes a city-wide delay. Just like tourists visiting a new city and having no idea where to go even though they might know the area well through online research, the subway is really unpredictable and you can never prepare the best for it and make everything smooth.

              If you ask me about the New York City subway, I would say, although a place for transportation, it is truly a wonderful placeâ€“ a place that is crazy <strong>
